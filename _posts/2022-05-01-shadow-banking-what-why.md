**Shadow banks** are not banks, but act like banks when it comes to credit intermediations (i.e., making loans to household and business and/or underwrite debt securities). The term "shadow bank" is coined in 2007 by Paul McCulley to describe its then nature of being levered, under-regulated and distant to the public [1]. It is really the 2008's Great Financial Crisis (GFC) that brings the shadow banking system to light, as it was later recognized as one of key factors leading up to the crisis[2].

In this post, I was sharing what I learned about what's about shadow banking and why it's interesting/important.

## What are shadow banks?

At the risk of oversimplication, let me first put up a few observations:

* shadow banks seek funding from market participants (e.g., money market funds or MMFs), rather than taking deposits from households. Thus, they rely on wholesale funding that could be unstable and sensitive to market conditions.  

* shadow banks perform credit intermediations similar to banks. But, instead of using traditional lending strategy "*originate-to-hold*", they tend to "*originate to distribute*"; once originated, they offload/sell credit assets to market investors.

* shadow banks create value to society by improving the efficiency of credit markets, due to their risk appetite, expertise and cost structure. In the meantime, they're also criticized for their imperfect credit risk transfer (e.g., stakeholders took excessive risks and remained under-compensated).

* shadow banks operate with limited regulations and oversight, and lacks the government backstopping *guarantees* during the stressed periods.

A thorough study on shadow banks was found in a series of works done by brilliant economists such as [3]. In the meantime, the shadow banking system has been closely monitored by the Financial Stability Board ([FSB](https://www.fsb.org/)) since 2011 [4][5]. After 7 year tracking and monitoring, the FSB decided in 2018 to move away from the term “shadow banking” and adopts “*nonbank financial intermediations*”([NBFIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-bank_financial_institution)) to reflect its "*emphasis the forward-looking aspect of the FSB’s work.*"[6]. In particular, the FSB watches closely three aggregates, defined by their business models, activities and associated vulnerabilities, that include *non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI)*, *OFIs (other financial intermediaries)*, and *narrow measure of NBFI*.  

**Narrow Measure of NBFI** are financial intermediaries that conduct involving *liquidity*, *maturity* and *credit* transformation as well as the build-up of *leverage*, without explicit access to central bank liquidity or public sector credit guarantees[3]. Hereafter, i'd like to use **narrow NBFIs** and **shadow banks** interchangeably given its similarity and overlapping.

## Why are NBFIs important?

In the 2020 annual monitoring report[7], nearly half (48.3%) of total global financial assets comes from the NBFIs; In a broader measure, it is reported to have $226.6 trillion, of which the narrow NBFIs have $63.2 trillion. A further breakdown indicates the collective investment vehicles (e.g., money market funds (MMFs) and fixed income funds) makes up the majority of the narrow NBFIs.

Annual reports from FSB has a laser focus on global welfare with limited details on individual countries. To fill the gap, I made/replicated calculations for U.S. shadow banking system.

Per my worksheet on the Fed's Flow of Funds, the shadow banks outsized the traditional banks; as of Dec-2021, the shadow banks have $31.5 trillion in financial assets, $1.4 trillion higher than banks and credit combined. Looking back on history, the shadow banks' asset has consistently surpassed traditional banks since the mid-1995, and reached the largest gap during the 08's crisis, since then the differences begins to shrink.

It should also be noted that the asset size should not be interpreted as a proxy for the net supply of credit provided by shadow banks for many reasons such as the originated credit has been sold to other investors and offload from their balance sheet. In the next post, i will try to explain how the shadow banking system are chained up in credit intermediation and related activities.
