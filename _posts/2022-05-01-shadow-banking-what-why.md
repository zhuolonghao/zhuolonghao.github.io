**Shadow banks** are not banks, but act like banks when it comes to credit intermediations (i.e., making loans to household and business and/or underwrite debt securities). The term "shadow bank" is coined in 2007 by Paul McCulley to describe its then nature of being levered, under-regulated and distant to the public [1], and the shadow banking was widely regarded as one of key factors leading up to the financial crisis of 2008 [2].

At the risk of oversimplication, let me list a few key observations about shadow banks below.

* they seek funding from market participants (e.g., money market funds or MMFs), rather than taking deposits from households. Thus, they rely on wholesale funding that could be unstable and sensitive to market conditions.  

* they perform credit intermediations similar to banks. But, instead of using traditional lending strategy "*originate-to-hold*", they tend to "*originate to distribute*"; once originated, they offload/sell credit assets to market investors.

* they bring values to improve market matching between borrowers and investors due to their speciliaztion and cost-efficient structure. In the meantime, they also receive criticism regarding the imperfect credit risk transfer.

* they operate with limited regulations and oversight, and lacks the government backstopping guarantees during the stressed periods.

Today, the shadow banking system is closely monitored by the Financial Stability Board ([FSB](https://www.fsb.org/)), an international body established post the 08's crisis for making recommendation about the global financial system. Since 2018, the FSB moved away from the term “shadow banking” and adopts “*nonbank financial intermediations*”([NBFIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-bank_financial_institution)). In particular, the FSB tracks and monitors three aggregates, based on their business models, activities and associated vulnerabilities. that include *non-bank financial intermediation (NBFI)*, *OFIs (other financial intermediaries)*, and *narrow measure of NBFI*. As of Dec-2021, NBFIs (or its narrow measure) is reported to have $226.6 trillion (or $63.2 trillion)in financial assets, making up 48.3 (or 13.5) percent of total financial assets held by 29 jurisdictions that account for approximately 80% of global GDP.

**Narrow Measure of NBFI** are financial intermediaries that conduct involving *liquidity*, *maturity* and *credit* transformation as well as the build-up of *leverage*, without explicit access to central bank liquidity or public sector credit guarantees[3].

Based on the author's calculation, the narrow measure of NBFI has $31.5 trillion in financial assets as of Dec-2021, which is roughly $1.4 trillion higher than the total assets of banks and credit combined. Looking back on history, the narrow measure's asset size surpassed the traditional bank since the mid-1995, and reached the largest gap during the 08's crisis. It should be also noted that the asset size should not be interpreted as a proxy for the net supply of credit provided by NBFIs for many reasons such as its originate-to-distribute business model. Therefore, it's of great importance to understand how the shadow banking is operating and interacting with other market participants.
