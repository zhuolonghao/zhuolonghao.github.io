It's important for institutional investors to assess corporate credit investment relative to other asset classes before deciding its desirable allocation to private credit investment within an overall portfolio.   

This post focused on the capital market assumptions and one of the most popular theoretical underpinnings of credit.

## Expected Return and Risk: Private Credit vs Other Asset Classes

For institutional investors, one of key inputs to determine the asset allocation is long-term reutrn and risk for individual asset classes. 
Below is the 2024-2033 capital market assumptions from Callan, an investment consulting firm. 
Their calculation indicates Private Credit would earn 7.4%, slightly higher than High Yied bond as compensation for illiquidity and complexity

## Expected Return Calculation: Private Credit - Corporate Lending

Nesbitt [1] provides an illustrative calculation for ten-year return forecasts for corporate lending based on eight key assumptions. 
- **Gross Yield** (Line 1) and **Credit Loss Rate** (Line 2) are two critical inputs that are estimates and hence subject to uncertainty.
- Leverage (Line 3) and Cost of Finance (Line 8) are equally important when leverage is used to enhance return.

## Merton's Theory for Expected Return

In Merton's world, the accounting equation and the put-call parity are married to give birth to a popular corporate credit pricing theory.
- **Accounting**: Asset = Equity + Liabilities 
- **Put-Call Parity**:  Call - Put = Discount * (Forward Price of Asset - Strike Price) 

**Equity investors / Shareholders** pay some price to have a claim on the residual interest in the firm's assets after deducting liabilities. Shareholders can be thought of buying a call option. In the same spirit, **Corporate lenders / Creditors** sell a put option, receive a credit risk premium, and expect full repayment at maturity plus interest. For example, buy an AAA-graded (or B-graded) bond with a face value of $100 at $98 (or $90).

Market Value of Asset = Market Cap of Equity + Total Liabilities - Credit Risk Premium
</p> 

With this insight, the Black-Scholes formula is easily applicable for estimating gross yield and credit loss rate. 
- gross yield = risk-free rate + *credit risk premium*
- credit loss rate = *default probability(PD)* * exposure at default(EAD) * loss given default(LGD)
