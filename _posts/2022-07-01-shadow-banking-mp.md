In this post, I'd narrow down the focus to money market mutual funds (MMMFs) and its role in the Fed's ["Balance Sheet Normarlization"](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/policy-normalization-discussions-communications-history.htm).

A MMMF is a kind of mutual fund that issues shares to investors and invests in a diverse set of short-term (often less than 1-year) assets such as US Treasuries and commercial papers. [Fidelity Money Market Fund](https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/summary/31617H201), for example, holds assets in commercial papers (26.43%, combined), certificate of deposit (22.88%), Repo (19.16%) and etc, as of April-2022.

</p>

Note that the portfolio composition is sensitive to market condition and subject to change at the discretion of the fund managers. A year earlier, the same fund allocated 41.2% and 12.7% to CPs and CDs, respectively, partly due to low credit risk and ample liquidity.

Note:

[Commercial Paper, CP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commercial_paper): unsecured and short-term (<270 days) debt instrument used to fund operating expense, inventory, and receivables. As a CP matures it is often replaced with newly issued CP (often called as rollover).
