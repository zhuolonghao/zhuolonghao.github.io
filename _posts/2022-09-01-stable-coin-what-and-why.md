<p class="meta">September 2022 - Charlotte, NC</p>

"*Stablecoins that are well-designed and subject to appropriate oversight have the potential to support beneficial payments options."*

â€• *Janet L. Yellen, Secretary of the Treasury*

Stablecoins are **private money** on distributed ledgers (blockchains).

The first stablecoin caught my eyes is the Libra-Now-Diem from Facebook-Now-Meta. Given the Meta's size and the deposit-like in nature, I cannot stop thinking that it may one day allure some deposits away from traditional financial system and eventually push up funding costs for banks and credit-union alike.

In this post, i was trying to introduce what's stablecoins and their main use cases.  

## What is it?

To date, stablecoins have no universal definition.

The [President's Working Group on Financial Markets](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/StableCoinReport_Nov1_508.pdf) regards stablecoins as

<blockquote>
    <p>Stablecoins are digital assets that are designed to maintain a stable value relative to a national
    currency or other reference assets.</p>
</blockquote>

The scholars consider stablecoins in [a broader scope](https://wifpr.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DeFi-Beyond-the-Hype.pdf). For example,

<blockquote>
    <p>Stablecoins are crypto-assets that attempt to peg their value to another asset or a basket of assets including reserve currencies or high-quality liquid asset (HQLA).</p>
</blockquote>

Stablecoins can also be perceived from the technology perspective. [One example](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/ifdp/files/ifdp1334.pdf) is

<blockquote>
    <p>Stablecoins are digital currencies recorded on distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), usually blockchains, that are pegged to a reference value.
    </p>
</blockquote>


## Why and why not?

The recent [turmoils](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency_bubble#Collapse_of_Terra-Luna) beg a question: do they survive and stay?

Meaningful use cases are driving force for sustainable/organic growths, like any other financial instruments. Below surveyed a few by its importance.

| Type |  Use Case | Details |
|---| --- |--- |
|Primary | Off-chain Payments |Facilitate p2p and cross-borader payments for purchase of goods \& services.|
|Primary | On-chain Payments |Facilitate trade of non-investment digital assets that are used for consumptive purpose.|
|Primary | DeFi |Underpinning for and core service in DeFi|
|Auxiliary|Digital safe assets |Hedging against excessive volatility in other crypto-assets  |
|Auxiliary| Yield Farming| lock up the liquidity or collateral provision by paying interest |
|Auxiliary| Internal transfers and liquidity management | allow efficient movement of internal cash across subsidiaries for business and regulatory management|

[This article](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27136/w27136.pdf) describes some institutional features that help explain the use of stablecoin.  
- Crypto exchanges accept stablecoins only.  
- Crypto exchanges impose fee when crypto token converted to U.S. Dollars.  
- Crypto exchanges use T+X settlement cycle for token redemption.


## What makes (us to believe) it "stable"?

Stablecoins purport to be stable because **it offers a promoise or expectation that the coin can be redeemed at par upon request**


TerraUST, a top tier stablecoin with $17bn market cap at its peak, falls apart within a few days in May 2020, wiping out the mysterious $ (e.g., [$60bn](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/28/60-billion-terra-washout-not-cryptos-bear-stearns-moment-regulators.html#:~:text=A%20contained%20event,%2C%20they're%20essentially%20worthless.) vs [$45bn](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_(blockchain)) vs [$40bn](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/18/technology/terra-luna-cryptocurrency-do-kwon.html))

Therefore, it's important to understand what backs up the claim that stablecoin is always redeemable 1:1 for U.S. Dollars. One may view or assess the popular stablecoins in two dimensions below.

|               | Centralized           | De-centralized |
| ------------- |:-------------:| :-----:|
| **Under-Collateralized**      | ??? | [TerraUST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terra_(blockchain)) |
| **Fully-Collateralized**      | [USDC](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc#) and [USDT](https://tether.to/en/transparency/#reports)      |   ??? |
| **Over-Collateralized**       | ???      |    [dai](https://makerdao.world/en/learn/Dai) |

A few comments:
1. USDC and USDT alike are similar to money market funds, investing in cash, bank deposits, CP, UST, and commodities like golds.
2. dai is over-collateralized by digital assets such as bitcoin and USDC.
3. TerraUST implements a two-token algorithm that expand and contract supply similiarly to the way central banks buy and sell fiscal debt to stabilize purchasing power (i.e., pegged to $1 dollar).
