"*Stablecoins that are well-designed and subject to appropriate oversight have the potential to support beneficial payments options."*

â€• *Janet L. Yellen, Secretary of the Treasury*

Stablecoins are **private money** on distributed ledgers (blockchains).

The first stablecoin that caught my attention is the Libra from Facebook (or now Meta). Given the Meta's size and influences, i cannot stop thinking that the stablecoin is so like deposits that it may one day erode banks' cheap sources of funds.

In this post, i was trying to introduce what's stablecoins and explain why it exists by outlining main use cases.  

## What is it?

To date, stablecoins have no universal definition. Below provides a few of them from different perspective.

The President's Working Group on Financial Markets defined in the [Report](https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/136/StableCoinReport_Nov1_508.pdf) stablecoins as

<blockquote>
    <p>Stablecoins are digital assets that are designed to maintain a stable value relative to a national
    currency or other reference assets.</p>
</blockquote>

The scholars inclined to consider stablecoins in [a broader scope](https://wifpr.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/DeFi-Beyond-the-Hype.pdf). For example,

<blockquote>
    <p>Stablecoins are crypto-assets that attempt to peg their value to another asset or a basket of assets including reserve currencies or high-quality liquid asset (HQLA).</p>
</blockquote>

Stablecoins can also be defined from the technology perspective. [One example](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/ifdp/files/ifdp1334.pdf) is

<blockquote>
    <p>Stablecoins are digital currencies recorded on distributed ledger technologies (DLTs), usually blockchains, that are pegged to a reference value.
    </p>
</blockquote>

Regardless of differences, they send a common message: **stablecoins offer a promoise or expectation that the coin can be redeemed at par upon request**

## Why need it?

A sustainable/organic growth in stablecoins cannot happen without robust use cases.

| Type |  Use Case | Details |
|---| --- |--- |
|Primary | Off-chain Payments |Facilitate p2p and cross-borader payments for purchase of goods \& services.|
|Primary | On-chain Payments |Facilitate trade of non-investment digital assets that are used for consumptive purpose.|
|Primary | DeFi |Underpinning for and core service in DeFi|
|
|Auxiliary|Digital safe assets |Hedging against excessive volatility in other crypto-assets  |
|Auxiliary| Yield Farming| lock up the liquidity or collateral provision by paying interest |
|Auxiliary| Internal transfers and liquidity management | allow efficient movement of internal cash across subsidiaries for business and regulatory management|


[This article](https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w27136/w27136.pdf) also noted investors are induced to use stablecoins over dollar, due to two institutional features  
- When trading cryptocurrencies for dollars, redemption periods could be longer and fees may be charged;
- Exchanges are united to accept only stablecoins as a medium of exchange.
