The rise and fall of Terra's algorithmic stablecoin system is "epic"; at the peak, it was the third largest stablecoin by market cap, but was wiped out just in the span of days.

[This article](https://www.coindesk.com/learn/the-fall-of-terra-a-timeline-of-the-meteoric-rise-and-crash-of-ust-and-luna/) details a timeline of Terra's journal from its underdog start as a payment to a $60 billion crypto ecosystem to one of the biggest failures in crypto. Below pinpoints key milestones:
