Shadow banks are not banks, but act like banks in credit intermediations (i.e., making loans to household and business and/or underwrite debt securities). The term "shadow bank" is coined in 2007 by Paul McCulley to describe its then nature of being levered, under-regulated and distant to the public [1], and the shadow banking was widely regarded as one of key factors leading up to the financial crisis of 2008 [2].

At the risk of oversimplication, let me list a few key observations about shadow banks below.
1. they seek funding from market participants (e.g., MMFs), rather than taking deposits from households. Thus, these wholesale funding could be unstable and sensitive to market conditions.  
2. they perform credit intermediations similar to banks. But, instead of "*originate-to-hold*", they tend to "*originate to distribute*"; selling a wider pool of credit (e.g., CDO, CLO and ABS) to investors.
3. They add some values through matching borrowers and investors efficiently and effectively, despite the credit risk transfer is opaque and far from perfect.
4. they operate with limited regulations and hence lacks the government backstopping guarantees during the stressed periods.

Today, they're closely monitored by Financial Stability Board and called as a narrow measure of *non-banking financial institution* or [NBFIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-bank_financial_institution) or a narrow measure .
