A company is regarded as highly leveraged when it has a credit rating of speculative-grade assigned by Credit Rating Agencies. 
The ratings are often assigned using both quantitative measures and qualitative judgments. 

This post introduces two rating methodologies and explores their connection with probability of default (PD).

## Moody's Credit Ratings

Moody's Investor Service **ranks** the creditworthiness of borrowers using a standardized rating scale from Aaa (the highest quality) to C (the lowest quality). 

These ratings are calculated as a weighted average of factors considered in the Scorecard. Below is a scorecard for Integrated Oil and Gas companies [1].
- at the top, it mainly considers financial metrics such as interest coverage, and balance sheet leverage.
- it also factors in the country's risk and local government policies, which may result in a downgrade adjustment.
- ratings may reflect additional factors that are difficult to quantify or measure, such as the quality and experience of management.

Despite the scorecard factors and their relative importance/weight differ across industries [2], it's helpful to summarize popular financial metrics without regard to industry classification. For instance, the table below presents the medians by broad rating category for global non-financial corporates as of Dec 2016 [3]. In general, the median for these metrics follows a monotonic relationship with ratings.

A speculative-grade company appears to have  
  * **Balance Sheet Leverage**: Debt/Book_Cap > 46.4%
  * **Operating Leverage**:  Debt/EBITDA > 2.9x
  * **Debt Service Coverage**: EBITA/Interest_Expense < 6.3x, (FFO+Interest_Expense)/Interest_Expense < 8.1x
  * **Free Cash Flow Coverage**: FFO/Debt < 27.1%, Retained_Cash_Flow/Net_Debt < 25.3%  
  * **Profitability**:  EBITA/Avg_Assets < 8.7%, EBITA_Margin < 13.9%, Operating_Margin < 12.0%
  * **Others**:, CapEx/Depreciation < 1.2x, Revenue_volatility > 10.7x

## Top Investment Banking's Credit Ratings

Large banks also develop internal scorecards that are customized to align with the bank's credit philosophy and strategic objectives. 
One key difference lies in how a bank defines each risk factor and asssess its relative importance. 

Table below illustrates the allocation of weights assigned to risk areas based on the size of borrowers. 
| Risk Area | Large Corp <br> (ann. rev: $750+MM) | Upper Middle Market <br> (ann. rev: $20 ~ 750MM) | Lower Middle Market <br> (ann. rev: <$20MM) | Special Corp  <br> (Sponsored)| 
|----| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Leverage    | 35%  | 40%  | 30% | 50%  |
| Coverage    | 40%  | 40%  | 30%  | 50%               |
| Profitability | -  | 15% | 10% | -                |
| Liquidity    | - | 5%  | 30% | - |
| Size    | 25% | - | - | - |

The borrower's size also influences the selection of metrics within each risk area, as does its threshold for highly leveraged borrowers. 
Below are a few examples. 

For Large-Corp,   
  * **Leverage**: Total_Debt/Adjusted_EBITDA > 3.75x (35%)
  * **Coverage**: (Net_cash_from_Op-CapEx)/Debt < 17x (25%)
  * **Coverage**: Adjusted_EBITDA/Interest_Expense < 5x (15%)
  * **Size**: net_profit_before_extra_items < $25MM (25%)

For Upper Middle Market, 
  * **Leverage**: Total_debt/Adjusted_EBITDA > 2.50x (20%),
  * **Leverage**: (Total_liabilities-Sub_debt)/(Tangible_net_worth-Sub_debt) > 2.50x (20%)
  * **Coverage**: (Net_income+D&A+Int_Exp+/-Net_distributions)/(CPLTD+CP_Finance_lease+Int_Exp) < 2.49x (20%)
  * **Coverage**: Adjusted_EBITDA/(CPLTD+CP_Finance_lease+Cash_Interest) < 2.75x (10%)
  * **Coverage**: (Adjusted_EBITDA-CapEx-Cash_Div-Cash_Taxes)/(CPLTD+CP_Finance_lease+Cash_Interest) < 1.60x (10%)
  * **Profitability**:  Net_income_before_tax/Total_Assets < 10% (15%)
  * **Liqudity**:, Current_Assets/Current_Liabilites < 2x (5%)

For Middle Market w/ Equity Sponsor, 
  * **Leverage**: (Total_Debt+Finance_Lease)/Adjusted_EBITDA > 3.25x (40%)
  * **Leverage**: (Senior_Debt+Finance_Lease)/Adjusted_EBITDA > 2.76x (10%) 
  * **Coverage**: (Adjusted_EBITDA-CapEx-Cash_Taxes)/(Cash_interest+Cash_distribution+1/14thx(Total_debt+Finance_lease)) < 1.75x  (30%)
  * **Coverage**: Adjusted_EBITDA/Cash_interest < 5x  (20%) 


Likewise, the scorecards consider such qualitative factors as historical trends, management/equity sponsor strength, market position, industry outlook, access to capital markets, and legal/regulatory/operational/reputational risk, which can override the scorecard-induced ratings.

## Credit Ratings != Default Probability

Credit ratings are over-the-time ratings used to *rank* the creditworthiness of borrowers. Therefore, credit ratings do not necessarily equate to default probabilities. It should be noted that 
- **Within a given year, a higher rating tends to have a lower default probability, and**
- **The default probability for the same rating can fluctuate from year to year, and**
- **The same rating category (e.g., BBB) can imply different default probabilities across different CRAs** 

Annual and cumulative default rates are useful:
- S&P Global's research [4] shows the *annual default rates* for BB (CCC) are 0.00% (29.61%) in 2019, 0.94% (47.88%)  in 2020, 0.00% (10.99%)  in 2021, and 0.32% (13.84%) in 2022.
- Moody's Investor Service [5] publishes the *cumulative default rates* based on history from 1970 to 2022.

  </p>

Therefore, investors must have accurate and reliable default probability forecasts for highly leveraged companies.
