A company is regarded as highly levered when it has a credit rating of speculative grade assigned by Credit Rating Agencies. 
The ratings are often assigned using both quantiative measures and qualitative judgements. 
This post provides brief descriptions of two such rating methodologies.

## Moody's Credit Ratings

Moody's Investor Service **ranks** the creditworthiness of borrowers using a standardized ratings scale from Aaa (the highest quality) to C (the lowest quality). 
These ratings are calculated as a weighted average of factors considered in the Scorecard. Below illustrates such scorecard for Integrated Oil and Gas companies [1]. 
At top, it considers mainly financials such as interest coverage and balance sheet leverage, along with busines profiles. Once

The scorecard factors and their relative importance(weight) often differe across industries []. 

Moody's Investor Service selected eleven (11) metrics and reported them by rating for global non-financial corporates as of Dec 2016 [2]. 
Note that these metrics are not necessarily used in scorecards (or rating methodology).

## Top Investment Banking's Credit Ratings


Stephen Nesbitt [2] estimates the US corporate debt market totaled approximately $12.6 trillion in Q1 2022, which includes $6.2T in investment-grade (IG) bonds. The remainder of investment grade debt, in loan form,  is encompassed within the $2.6T Bank Commercial and Industrial (C&I) Loans [3]. It's unclear, however, what the distribution of C&I loans between IG and below-IG looks like, as it's a strategic decision that differs for each bank. 

In the broadest sense, the LevFin consists of $1.4T in High-Yield Corporate Bonds (HY), $1.4T in Broadly Syndicated Loans (BSL), $1.0T in Direct Lending (aks Private Credit), along with a leveraged portion of $2.6T in Bank C&I loans.

## Credit Ratings vs Default Probability

Credit Rating by Moody's Investor Service is to rank creditworthiness, while default probability (e.g., EDF by Moody's Analytics) quantifies credit risk in more precise and timely manner. 
In other words ,credit rating is a relatively coarse measurment of default probility when comparing to EDF.

Likewise, S&P global also published its rating-to-default_prob [linkages](https://www.spglobal.com/ratings/en/research/articles/240328-default-transition-and-recovery-2023-annual-global-corporate-default-and-rating-transition-study-13047827)
