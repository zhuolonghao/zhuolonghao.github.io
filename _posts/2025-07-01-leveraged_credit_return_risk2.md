An analytical framework for evaluating the profitability of credit investment has been outlined on the [previous post](https://zhuolonghao.github.io/2024/08/01/leveraged_credit_return_risk.html). 
We studies a Mark-to-Model pricing model that translates different inputs into a projected return. 
This is fundamental to assessing whether a credit investment is profitable relative to its risks and to other asset classes.
