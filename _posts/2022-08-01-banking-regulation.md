"*Stronger regulation and supervision aimed at problems with underwriting practices and lenders' risk management would have been a more effective and surgical approach to constraining the housing bubble than a general increase in interest rates.*"

― **Ben S. Bernanke**, at the 2010 AEA meeting, Atlanta, GA

The Federal Reserve influences the macroeconomics throught its conventional monetary policies (e.g., FFT) as well as unconventional measures (e.g., QE and QT). Apart from these tools, the Fed also exerts regulations on the banking industy as an response to the 2008's crisis. Two main focuses of these regulations are to ensure capital adequacy and improve liquidity poistion; the former aims to curb the excessive risk-taking behaviors, while the latter helps reduce the chances of bank runs during the stress periods. 

In this post, i will discuss the major regulatory metrics below used to evaluate banks' capital and liquidity situation. 


$$ 
\begin{split}
\text{Common Equity Tier-1 Ratio} \quad &= \quad \frac{\text{Common Equity Tier-1 Capital}}{\text{Risk Weighted Assets}} \\
\\
\text{Supplementary Leverage Ratio} \quad &= \quad \frac{\text{Tier 1 Capital}}{\text{Total Leverage Exposure}} \\
\\
\text{Total Loss Absorbing Capacity, ver. 1} \quad &= \quad \frac{\text{Tier 1 Capital + Unsecured LT Debt}}{\text{Risk Weighted Assets}} \\
\\
\text{Total Loss Absorbing Capacity, ver. 2} \quad &= \quad \frac{\text{Tier 1 Capital + Unsecured LT Debt}}{\text{Total Leverage Exposure}} \\
\\
\text{Liquidity Coverage Ratio} \quad &= \quad \frac{\text{High-Quality Liquid Assets}}{\text{Net Cash Outflow Over The Next 30 Days}} \\
\\
\text{Net Stable Funding Ratio} \quad &= \quad \frac{\text{Available Amount Of Stable Funding}}{\text{Required Amount of Stable Funding}} \\
\end{split}
$$
