**Leveraged Finance** or **LevFin** refers to debt financing of highly levered / speculative-grade companies. They raise debt capital through loan and bond underwriting. 

Debt issuances often receive a rating from major credit rating agencies, such as S&P Global Ratings (S&P). 
Per S&P's analysis [1], among *rated* corporates, speculative-grade represents 51% of issuers, despite they just account for 22% of *rated* debt. 
For those non-rated, they are often comparable to speculative-grade. 
That's, there's a huge universe of companies without investment-grade ratings.

## Place LevFin in the big picture of US corporate debt market

Stephen Nesbitt [2] estimates the US corporate debt market totaled approximately $12.6 trillion as of March 31, 2022. The debt financing to US companies with below investment grade consists of High-Yield Corporate Bonds (HY) at $1.4 trillion, Broadly Syndicated Loans (BSL) at $1.4 trillion, Direct Lending (aka Private Credit) at $1.0 trillion, **and a fraction of Bank Commerical and Industrial Loans (C&I) at $2.6 trillion**. 

My survey shows the LevFin market can be assessed ranging from $2.8 trillion (HY+BSL) to $3.8 trillion (HY+BSL+Private Credit). In fact, the broadest LevFin should further include these C&I bank loans lent to highly leveraged banks' clients, although it's very difficult to know exactly the fraction.
