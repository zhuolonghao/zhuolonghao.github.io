**Leveraged Finance** is about the financing of highly levered / speculative-grade companies. They raise debt capital through loan and bond underwriting. 

Debt issuances often receive a rating from major credit rating agencies, such as S&P Global Ratings (S&P). 
Per S&P's analysis [1], among *rated* corporates, speculative-grade represents 51% of issuers, despite they just account for 22% of *rated* debt. 
For those non-rated, they are often comparable to speculative-grade. 
That's, there's a huge universe of companies without investment-grade ratings.
