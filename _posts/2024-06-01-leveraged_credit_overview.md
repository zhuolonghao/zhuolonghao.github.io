**Leveraged Finance** or **LevFin** refers to debt financing of highly levered / speculative-grade companies. They raise debt capital through loan and bond underwriting. 

Debt issuances often receive a rating from major credit rating agencies, such as S&P Global Ratings (S&P). 
Per S&P's analysis [1], among *rated* corporates, speculative-grade represents 51% of issuers, despite they just account for 22% of *rated* debt. 
For those non-rated, they are often comparable to speculative grades. 
That's, there's a huge universe of companies without investment-grade ratings.

## Size of LevFin in US corporate debt market

Stephen Nesbitt [2] estimates the US corporate debt market totaled approximately $12.6 trillion in Q1 2022, which includes $6.2T in investment-grade (IG) bonds. The remainder of investment grade debt, in loan form,  is encompassed within the $2.6T Bank Commercial and Industrial (C&I) Loans [3]. It's unclear, however, what the distribution of C&I loans between IG and below-IG looks like, as it's a strategic decision that differs for each bank. 

In the broadest sense, the LevFin consists of $1.4T in High-Yield Corporate Bonds (HY), $1.4T in Broadly Syndicated Loans (BSL), $1.0T in Direct Lending (aks Private Credit), along with a leveraged portion of $2.6T in Bank C&I loans.

## Historical Trend of LevFin

As the size of C&I leveraged loans is not publicly available, some narrower measures of LevFini are often used. 
For example, Nini and Smith [4] and Fidelity restrict the LevFin market to large borrowers (HY + BSL), while Gatto [5] argues the private credit market for middle-market borrowers is also an essential component (LevFin = HY + BSL + Direct Lending). 
Here, we're sharing the historical trend of LevFin using Gatto's version. 

Per Gatto's account, The non‐investment grade debt markets have grown by roughly 7x over the last 20 years, driven by the growing acceptance of more-levered companies, the growth of private equity, and investor demand for a higher rate of return. 
Nesbitt even suggests that direct lending is now a real challenger to the traditional bank C&I loan business and has the potential to claim a sizable market from its competitors. 
The narrative seems to jibe well with the WSJ report [6].
