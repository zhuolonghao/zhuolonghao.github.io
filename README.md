# Let's try something fun
curious how to create website via github pages

On 4/12, created the first page

* README.MD file is what i saw in GitHub. [Syntax cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)

* index.html file is what i saw on internet.

* [this blog](https://tom.preston-werner.com/) looks nifty, try to replicate [its style](https://github.com/mojombo/mojombo.github.io).

On 4/13, re-created the page by using the blog's template

On 4/14, re-sized the font for title, headings, and body.

On 4/15, best way to modify the style is to start with the Inspect function embedded in Chrome Browser. Changes are immediately reflected once parameters are chagned.
